                <p class="description">Professional developers have switch today to using <strong>CSS-preprocessor
                    stylesheets</strong>. But, this does not exclude the facts that, many other developers are still
                    wondering if they should make the switch over to using a <strong>CSS-preprocessor</strong> like
                    <strong>SASS , LESS and Stylus</strong> instead of just <strong>plain CSS</strong>. Over these three
                    most popular CSS-Preprocessor, We will focus more on SASS to illustrate the advantage of <strong>CSS-Preprocessors</strong>
                    over <strong>Traditional CSS</strong>. In this article I will start with by answering; What is
                    css-preprocessor ? And then followed by sharing with you a few reasons that convinced me to make the
                    switch over to using SASS for all my projects.</p>

                <h4 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">1- Technically there’s no learning curve
                    at all</h4>
                <p class="description">Valid css code are valide sass code. so, for exemple. All you do is introduce
                    variables for your color palette into your code, you have already saved enough time in maintenance
                    to justify the tiny learning curve</p>

                <h4 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">2- Reusable Color Scheming</h4>
                <p class="description">Another <strong>benefit of SASS</strong> is that it allows us to define variables
                    that are reusable throughout our entire project. This provides a huge benefit when working with
                    things like colors and fixed width sizes. Let’s take the example of color scheming for a minute and
                    look at the traditional CSS vs. the new and improved SASS workflow. In plain CSS you may declare
                    your body to have a background of <span class="code">#CCC</span>. Of course your footer text color
                    may be <span class="code">#CCC</span>, along with your border around images, as well as the
                    highlight background of any links that are clicked. So in your CSS stylesheet you may declare <span
                            class="code">background: #CCC;</span> and <span class="code">color: #CCC</span> twenty or
                    thirty times throughout your project. What happens if your client comes back and would like the
                    color changed to something a little lighter like <span class="code">#ededed</span>? You would have
                    to locate all the references to <span class="code">#CCC</span> and change them to <span
                            class="code">#ededed</span>. What a hassle! Enter a new and improved workflow with SASS. In
                    SASS syntax you would simply declare a variable named <span class="code">$light-gray;</span> Any
                    time you needed to use the color <span class="code">#CCC</span>, you would simply declare
                    background: <span class="code">$light-gray</span>. Very simple. In the future when you need to
                    change the color to <span class="code">#ededed</span> you simply go to that variable reference and
                    change $light-gray to <span class="code">#ededed</span> – one time instead of thirty times; what a
                    time-saver!</p>

                    code quality by using the @import Attribute</h4>
                <p class="description">A few years back web experts were recommending that you separate your css files
                    into separate files based on the content i.e. fonts, colors, inputs, buttons etc. One of the
                    drowback with this approach is that you will have a huge number of HTTP requests on your website,
                    which will slow down the load time of your website. However, because SASS uses a Ruby complier we
                    are able to break up our stylesheets into multiple files and then have one “style.scss” that
                    “@import”s all the various other stylesheets when it is compled and this can be later minified on
                    compilation.</p>

                    using the attribut @extend</h4>
                <p class="description">Another feature of SASS that begins to utilize some of its power is the @extend
                    attribute. With @extend you can include styles into other classes that belong to a base class. Ok,
                    let me explain with an example.</p>
                <p class="description">Let’s say you are going to style 3 different images in the footer which will have
                    most of the same styles with a slight modification. Well instead of writing <span class="code">.card1 { … styles } .card2 { …styles… } card3 { …styles… }</span>
                    SASS has a better way. With SASS you simply write <span class="code">.card { …main styles… }</span>
                    and then <span class="code">.card1 { @extend .card; specific styles … }, .card2 { @extend .card; specific styles … }</span>
                    and so on. This can not only result in a huge time savings, but it keeps your code more organized as
                    well.</p>
                <p class="description">Now, you can do something similar to this in CSS by listing the classes like
                    .image1, .image2, .image3 but this way is sometimes so cumbersome I find that a lot of designers
                    will simply type out the code again forgetting to use that technique. The SASS way is much easier
                    and more update friendly.</p>
